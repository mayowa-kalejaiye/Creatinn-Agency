# The Creatinn Agency — Starter Next.js Site

This repo contains a minimal Next.js (App Router) scaffold with Tailwind CSS and a hero section implemented using Framer Motion.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes
- The hero uses placeholder avatar images at `/public/avatars/*.jpg`. Replace these with real images or update the markup.
- To add `shadcn` components or more libraries, install them and follow their setup instructions.
